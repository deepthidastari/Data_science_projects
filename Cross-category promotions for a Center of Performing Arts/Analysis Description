Goal of the project : 
Build a model to find association rules between different categories of shows offered by the Center of Peforming Arts

Model details:

Model type : Built a Carma Association Model using IBM SPSS
Inputs: Binary (T/F) flags for each category indicating whether a customer had purchased an item in the category.
Details : Model uses partitioned data for validation and requires a minimum of 20% support and confidence for each rule
Output : Generated 50 association rules. 

Insights: 

1) Broadway tickets and subscriptions are strongly associated. Other rules involving Broadway, Performing Arts, and 
Subscriptions have strong support with medium confidence. 

2) Since subscriptions make up the fast majority of purchases, rules involving subscriptions tended to overshadow rules independent of 
subscriptions. In order to understand the interactions of the various types of shows, we eliminated all rules involving subscriptions. 
Broadway and Performing Arts rules perform relatively well. However, the rules containing the Live shows performed poorly on either support
or confidence. 

Recommendations:

1) Continue exploring cross-category promotions for Broadway and Performing Arts series.
2) Offering subscriptions for Live shows may be beneficial
3) Adding dollar amounts for each show would allow us to determine what ticket packages are most profitable.
