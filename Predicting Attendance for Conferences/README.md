Your company, Zyco Co., organizes free conferences in various locations in India. Recently, the company has found that a lot of 
candidates are not turning up to the conferences after enrolling themselves. Based on the data collected from the candidates during 
the registeration process, the company Zyco Co. wants you to identify candidates who are at a risk of not attending the conference 

# a. Create a model predicting if a candidate will attend the conference. This will be indicated by the "Observed Attendance" column in 
     the data set. Create the model only using the records where this column is not null
# b. Provide a probability and a prediction for the candidates where the "Observed Attendance" column is null.
