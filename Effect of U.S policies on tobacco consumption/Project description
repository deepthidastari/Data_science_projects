U.S. Public Policy Attack on Tobacco Use: Do These Policies Really Work?

Project Goal : 

The goal of this project is to determine how smokefree indoors legislation, tobacco tax legislation, and tobacco health policy funding
from 1996 to 2013 have impacted tobacco usage rates by State in the United States. 

Data Understanding :

We collected our data from the CDC public website.We aggregated 5 different datasets(Smokefree Indoors Restrictions, Smokefree Indoors Penalties
,Funding Per Capita,Cigarette Tax/ pack, Little Cigar Tax/ pack) by state and year. 

We analysed the percentage of smokers of different age groups across different years ie; from 1996 to 2013. The survey question was-- 
"do you smoke now?"-- and the answers were yes or no. As you can expect ppl from the age group 25 to 44 have the highest percentage of 
smoking followed by ppl in the age group of 18 to 24 years. And less of the people in the age group 65 years and older currently smoke


Modeling Aproach:

Base Model : Logistic regression with all 4 inputs
Target variable: percent smokers
Input variables: cigarette tax, funding per capita, age group, educational levels
R-squared = 0.7374

Forward Selection : age and cigarette tax are the variables selected to be included in the model, but we couldnâ€™t see much improvement

Clustering analysis:
K-means clustering to group states with similar smokefree indoors restrictions and penalties statutes(primarily on restrictions and penalties for restaurants, bars, and hotels.)

Logistic regression on Clusters:
Input: cluster # and all other previous logistic regression inputs
Target: Percentage smokers
For K = 5 clustered logistic regression, R-squared : 0.7409
For K = 15 clustered logistic regression, R-squared : 0.7527


Insights :
1) Higher cigarette taxes decrease the odds that an individual will smoke
2) Smokefree legislation restricting smoking in restaurants, bars, and hotels reduces the odds of an individual choosing to smoke
3) Policy funding has no significant impact on smoking rates.

Recommendations :
1)States should maintain high taxes on cigarettes to reduce smoking rates
2)States should continue to explore smokefree indoors policies
3)States should carefully analyze the success of funding for tobacco programs
